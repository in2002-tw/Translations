## Getting Started
 1. Sign into GitHub if you aren't already signed in
 2. Fork this repo
 3. Create a copy of **English.vb** and name it **ageName.vb** (i.e. **Klingon.vb**)
 4. Edit the age file that corresponds with your age by going to your forked copy and then clicking the little pen icon at the bottom right of the page)
 5. Alternatively, you can create a clone of the fork locally through GitHub desktop then push your changes back to the origin when finished
 6. Come back to this repo and make a new pull request
 7. One of us will check out the translation and approve it once we confirm the translation with another party
 8. If approved, your username will be mentioned in seDirector as a contributor!
 9. Make sure to change the comments section at the top of the age file

### Rules to Follow

 1. Do not translate if you don't read and write the age
 2. If you see HTML tags in the English version, do NOT change/remove the HTML tags, just replace words/phrases as needed
 3. Keep the case the same - if it's capitalized, capitalize the translation; if there is a period, use a period in the translation, if it has a comma, use commas, etc.
 4. Use single-quotes in-place of double-quotes, ' instead of "
 5. There will be duplicate translations - keep them
 6. When you see a number in braces, that is a tag that means a variable will go there.  Keep the **{0**} or **{1}** tags in the translation.  As long as it makes the same sense as the English version, you can move them as needed.
 7. If you are unsure of a translation, have a friend help you out before you create a pull request
